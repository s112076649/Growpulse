# GrowPulse Open Source Security Policies and Procedures

This document outlines security procedures and general policies for the
GrowPulse Open Source projects as found on https://github.com/growpulse.

- [Reporting a Vulnerability](#reporting-a-vulnerability)
- [Patching and Releasing](#patching-and-releasing)
- [Disclosure Process](#disclosure-process)

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The GrowPulse team take all reports of security vulnerabilities
seriously. Report security vulnerabilities by emailing the GrowPulse security team at:

    security@growpulse.io

The GrowPulse team will acknowledge your email within 48 hours, and will send a
more detailed response within 72 hours indicating the next steps in handling
your report. After the initial acknowledgement of your report, the security team will keep you
informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for
additional information or guidance.

**IMPORTANT: Do not file public issues on GitHub for security vulnerabilities**

Security is of the highest importance and all security vulnerabilities or suspected security vulnerabilities should be reported to GrowPulse privately, to minimize attacks against current users of GrowPulse before they are fixed. Vulnerabilities will be investigated and patched as soon as possible.

## Patching and Releasing

The GrowPulse team will respond to vulnerability reports as follows:

1.  The security team will investigate the vulnerability and determine its effects, criticality and scope.
2.  If the issue is found to be valid, the code will be patched and released as quickly as possible.
3.  We will attempt to identify and notify the effected users directly as soon as possible, as well as following steps mentioned in our [Disclosure Process](#disclosure-process). A public disclosure date may be negotiated by the GrowPulse Security Team, and the bug submitter if required.

## Disclosure Process

The security team publishes a public [security advisory](https://github.com/growpulse/growpulse/security/advisories) via GitHub. Depending on the scope of the issue, additional details may be communicated via Slack, Email, Twitter, blog and/or other channels to assist in educating GrowPulse users in rolling out a patched version.
